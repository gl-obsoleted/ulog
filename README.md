This repo is **no longer maintained**, its main value has been merged into other works of mine. 

- The logging facilities it provided for Unity projects has been merged into [PerfAssist/**PA_Common**](https://github.com/PerfAssist/PA_Common) 
- A live working Unity demo project about "1) how to use the logging library 2) how to upload logging files" is provided as [one of PerfAssist Demos (**PADemo_Logging**)](https://github.com/PerfAssist/PADemo_Logging)
- The logging server (which accepts the uploaded logging files) has been merged into mc_server (which is currently privately maintained [2016-12-13]). 

Let me know if you have any further questions about it.
